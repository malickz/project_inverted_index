<H2>SOUTHEAST CHINA CROPS SAVED BY HEAVY RAIN</H2>
The heaviest rains for seven months are
believed to have saved more than one mln hectares of
drought-threatened crops in southeast China, the official New
China News Agency said.
    This week's rains have alleviated drought conditions in
Guangdong Province, the agency said.
    China has warned that this year's harvest will be affected
by drought in many areas.
