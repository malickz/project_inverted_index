<H2>CCC INTEREST HIGHER IN JUNE, USDA SAYS</H2>
Interest rates on commodity loans
disbursed by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) this month
will carry a 6-7/8 pct interest rate, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    That is up from the May rate of 6-1/4 pct and reflects the
interest rate charged the CCC by the U.S. Treasury in June,
USDA noted.
