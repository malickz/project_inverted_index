<H2>GOODYEAR GT TO RECEIVE 588 MLN DLRS FOR UNIT</H2>
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it
will receive about 588 mln dlrs in cash from Loral Corp LOR
for the business of Goodyear Aerospace Corp.
    Goodyear said the previously announced acquisition by Loral
is expected to be completed March 13. When Loral announced the
transaction January 12, the company said it was paying 640 mln
dlrs for Goodyear Aerospace.
    Goodyear said the price it will receive is after
adjustments for such items as pension and benefits provision,
allocation of liabilities and asset valuations. Last year
Goodyear Aerospace had revenues of 695 mln dlrs.
