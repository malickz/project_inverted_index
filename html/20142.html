Computer Memories Inc said its
board has decided to take additional time to evaluate the
impact of litigation on the proposed acquisition of Hemdale
Film Corp.
    Computer Memories said it plans to adjourn its annual
shareholders meeting, scheduled for October 23, after it is
convened. One purpose of the meeting is to consider the
transaction, the company explained.
    Computer Memories said Hemdale agrees with this course of
action.
