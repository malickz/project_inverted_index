Hoechst AG's HFAG.F U.S. unit,
Hoechst Celanese Corp, said it has begun projects that will
cost more than 150 mln dlrs.
    The unit was formed last month when Hoechst completed the

    The company said it will expand its Sanwet super absorbent
polymers unit and its acrylic acid facility. It also said it
plans an acetaminophen production plant at Bishop, Texas.
