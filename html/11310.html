Products said it and Vacuumschmelze GmbH signed a licensing
agreement whereby each may practice the other's technology for
amorphous metals in magnetic applications.
    Amorphous metal products are used in such devices as
switch-mode power supplies and other electronic components.
They are based on a proprietary rapid solidification process
that gives metals a glasslike molecular structure, making them
stronger, more ductile and corrosion-resistant, with unusual
magnetic charateristics.
