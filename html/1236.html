<H2>FBI CHIEF WEBSTER REFUSES COMMENT ON CIA POST</H2>
FBI Director William Webster refused
all comment on whether he has been approached to head the
Central Intelligence Agency.
    After testifying before a Senate Judiciary Committee,
Webster answered repeatedly with "no comment" when asked by
reporters if he has been approached.
    Webster has been mentioned as a possible top choice to head
the spy agency following President Reagan's forced withdrawal
of the nomination of acting director Robert Gates, to succeed
ailing ex-CIA chief William Casey.
