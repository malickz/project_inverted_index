<H2>STOLTENBERG ASSUMES COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE</H2>
The West German government assumes that the
commitment to international monetary cooperation which was
renewed in Washington last month will continue, a Finance
Ministry spokesman quoted Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
as saying.
    Stoltenberg's statement was a reaction to criticism of
rises in West German interest rates voiced by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker over the weekend.
