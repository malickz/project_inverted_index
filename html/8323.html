<H2>BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER DEFENDS AUSTERITY PROGRAM</H2>
Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens said government austerity programs adopted in the last
six years had resolved some of the economy's urgent problems,
but that unemployment remained a major obstacle.
    Martens told Belgian television the austerity measures had
brought the country's balance of payments from deficit to
surplus, helped reduce inflation and boosted economic growth.
