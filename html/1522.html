<H2>STRONG POINT UNIT TO MARKET PRODUCT IN EUROPE</H2>
Strong Point Inc said its
Pharmaceutical Technologies Inc subsidiary will market in
Europe its Immunol-RD nutritional product, designed to protect
individuals exposed to medium or minimal radiation dosage
levels.
    The company said it will market the product in Europe
because of the radiation exposure from the Chernobyl nucelar
power accident.
    The company asserted that the product can offset the
deleterious effects of radiation, which weakens the immune
system.
