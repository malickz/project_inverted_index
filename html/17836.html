<H2>E-SYSTEMS ESY SEES REDUCED SECOND QUARTER</H2>
E-Systems said it expects earnings for the
second quarter will likely be below prior expectations due to a
reduction in investment income and higher than expected costs
on several power amplifier programs.
    The company said it does not expect to match the 52 cts a
share net income reported for the second quarter last year.
