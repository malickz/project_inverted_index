<H2>SINGER SMF GETS TEXAS AIR TEX CONTRACT</H2>
Singer Co said it has signed a
12-year contract with Texas Air Corp's Continental Airlines Inc
unit to lease Continental an aircraft simulator for flight crew
training.
    Singer said it will also market training on the simulator
to other airlines.
    The company said initially it will provide a simulator for
McDonnell Douglas Corp's MD-80 but will replace that simulator
in 1988 with one for the MD-82.
