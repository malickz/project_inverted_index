<H2>NAKASONE SAYS DOLLAR FALL ONLY TEMPORARY</H2>
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the
dollar's sharp fall against the yen overnight was only
temporary.
    The dollar dropped sharply in New York after news that Paul
Volcker would step down as chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve.
    Nakasone told reporters he did not expect U.S. Policy to
change after Volcker steps down.
