<H2>BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SHORTLY AFTER TOKYO OPENS</H2>
The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of
dollars at around 145.95 yen shortly after the Tokyo market
opened, dealers said.
    But the dollar then fell on speculative selling by trading
houses, they said.
    The dollar had opened here at 145.95 yen against 145.85/90
yen in New York and 146.00 yen at the close here yesterday.
