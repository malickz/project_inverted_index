<H2>JAPAN MULLING CHANGES TO CORPORATE DISCLOSURE RULES</H2>
The Finance Ministry will institute a
study to consider changing the corporate disclosure rules to
provide more information for investors, a ministry official
said.
    The study will look at whether companies should include
data on profits for separate divisions, products and overseas
regions in corporate earnings statements the official said.
    At present, companies give such breakdowns for sales only.
    He said no time limit has been set for the study.
