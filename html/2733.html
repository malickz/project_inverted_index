<H2>SHULTZ, SHEVARDNADZE SAID TO MEET IN APRIL</H2>
Secretary of State George Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnaze will meet in Moscow
in mid-April, administration sources said.
    The sources said they will meet April 13 to 16 and are
expected to discuss the full range of U.S.-Soviet issues.
    But arms control is expected to be the major focus of the
talks, with a breakthrough widely expected on removing
medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
