The Cyprus Bank Employees' Union called
off a threatened strike following a meeting last night of the
union's executive committee, the Commercial Bankers Association
and Labour Minister Andreas Moushouttas.

agreement reached at the meeting. Union demands included an
annual 3.5 pct pay increase for the next two years and a
five-day working week.
