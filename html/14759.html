<H2>COMSAT CQ CHANGES NAME OF HI-NET UNIT</H2>
Communications Satellite Corp said it
changed the name of its Hi-Net Communications unit to Comsat
Video Enterprises to better reflect the nature of the unit's
operations.
    Comsat recently took full control of Hi-Net, which provides
in-room entertainment to hotels by satellite, by acquiring
Holiday Corp's HIA 50 pct interest in the firm.
    In addition, Comsat said it signed new seven-year contracts
with LaQuinta Motor Inns Inc LQM and Drury Inns Inc.
