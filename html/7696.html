<H2>USACAFES USF SETS HIGHER DIVIDEND</H2>
USACafes LP said its board declared a
quarterly dividend of 20 cts per unit -- its first since
converting to a limited partnership.
    The company, as USACafes Inc, had paid a quarterly dividend
of nine cts per share.
    It said the restructuring as a partnership has
substantially increased the cash available for distribution to
unitholders, as it had predicted.
