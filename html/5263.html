<H2>AQUINO DISBANDS VIGILANTE GROUPS</H2>
President Aquino has ordered the
dissolution of all armed civilian vigilante groups around the
Philippines, officials said.
    The order follows protests about the activities of
vigilantes by human-rights activists, but goes against calls by
the military for more such groups.
    The vigilantes have been credited with a major role in
recent successes in several districts against communist rebels.
