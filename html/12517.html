<H2>ELECTROMEDICS ELMD TO TAKE 1ST QTR CHARGE</H2>
Electromedics Inc said it
expects to take a 150,000 dlr charge against first quarter
results due to the conversion of debentures.
    The company said, however, it expects "positive" operating
comparisons for the period.  Electromedics lost 6,000 dlrs in
last year's first quarter.
