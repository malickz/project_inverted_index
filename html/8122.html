<H2>ISRAELI JETS RAID SOUTH LEBANON</H2>
Israeli jets bombed Palestinian
targets in south Lebanon for the second time in four days,
Lebanese security sources said.
    They said the planes attacked targets in the Darb al-Sim
area a few kms east of Sidon.
    Israeli planes carried out a similar raid in the same area
on Friday, hitting two buildings used by guerrillas loyal to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
