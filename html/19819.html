Yugoslavia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) have agreed to initiate efforts to end the Iraq-
Iran war, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rashid
Abdulla al-Nuaimi said today on return from Belgrade.
    "We agreed during the talks to initiate efforts to end the
Iraq-Iran war, call for an international peace conference for
the Middle East and to revive and support the Non-Aligned
states," the Emirates news agency WAM quoted him as saying.
    He was the first senior UAE official to visit Yugoslavia
