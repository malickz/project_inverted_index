<H2>NORWEGIANS MAY HAVE SOLD MORE COMPUTERS TO USSR</H2>
The Norwegian company Konsgberg
Vaapenfabrikk (KV) may have sold more high technology defence
equipment since an original deal in 1982, senior justice
officials said.
    State prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch told s he had
started fresh investigations into the state-owned arms firm
which delivered computers to the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1983,
used to make near-silent submarine propellers.
    "There may have been other deliveries of the same equipment
since then," he said.
