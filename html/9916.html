Warner-Lambert Co said it
has filed suit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against
Mason Distributors Inc, alleging unfair competition.
    It said the suit results from Mason's distribution of
children's allergy medicine in packages allegedly resembling
those of Warner-Lambert's Benadryl capsules and elixir.
