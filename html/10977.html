<H2>CERMETEK CRMK INCREASES WORK WEEK</H2>
Cermetek Microelectronics Inc
said it will return to a full 40 hour work week, efective at
the end of this month, as a result of increased business.
    Last October Cermetek, a maker of modems, data base access
and communications terminals, reduced its work week to 36 hours
to reduce costs.
