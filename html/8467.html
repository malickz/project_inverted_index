<H2>BELLSOUTH BLS COMPLETES PURCHASE FOR SHARES</H2>
BellSouth Corp said it completed its
previously-announced agreement to acquire Dataserv Inc for an
exchange of shares.
    BellSouth said under the Nov 25, 1986, agreement, it
exchanged one of its common shares for every 13.3 Dataserv
common shares. The exchange reflects the Feb 23 three-for-two
BellSouth stock split, the company said.
