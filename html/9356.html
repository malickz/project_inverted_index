<H2>ARGENTINE PORT WORKERS TAKE INDUSTRIAL ACTION</H2>
Argentine port workers began an
indefinite protest against safety conditions at the port of
Buenos Aires, stopping work for one hour per shift, a press
spokesman said.
    He said three port workers had died over the last month in
accidents. He said the decision to take action was made after a
port worker died yesterday after being electrocuted.
