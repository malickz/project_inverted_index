<H2>STALEY STA SELLS INTEREST IN SPANISH VENTURE</H2>
Staley Continental Inc
said it sold its 50 interest in Sociedad Iberica de
Molturacion, S.A. (Simsa), a soybean and sunflower seed
processing company based in Madrid, Spain.
    Staley's investment in Simsa no longer fit its overall
coporate strategy and an agreement to sell the interest was
completed in May, it said.
    Staley said the Simsa transaction will not have a material
effect on its balance sheet.
