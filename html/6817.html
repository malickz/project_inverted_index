<H2>NATIONAL DATA NDAC IN PACT WITH SIGNATURE</H2>
National Data Communications Inc said it
is no longer obligated to issue its majority shareholder
Signature Capital Corp 20 mln common shares under a previous
agreement.
    National said it entered into a new agreement with
Signature, which would have owned about 80 pct of National's
common under the prior pact.
    Under the new pact, National said it granted Signature a
five-year option to acquire two mln shares of its common for an
option price equal to its current market value. National has
about 15.3 mln shares outstanding.
