<H2>TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT</H2>
The central bank issued 4.03 billion
Taiwan dlrs of certificates of deposit (cds), bringing cd
issues so far this year to 134.5 billion dlrs, a bank official
told s.
    The new cds, with maturities of six months, one and two
years, carry interest rates ranging from 4.07 to 5.12 pct, he
said.
    The issues are intended to help curb the growth of M-1b
money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange
reserves.
    The reserves are now well over 51 billion U.S. Dlrs.
