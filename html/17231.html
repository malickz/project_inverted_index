<H2>BALDRIGE SAYS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL NOT PRODUCTIVE</H2>
The U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige said a further decline of the dollar would not
be productive.
    He told reporters here that Treasury Secretary James Baker
"feels, and I feel the same way, that a further dollar fall
would be counterproductive."
    Baldrige also said governments cannot determine long-term
currency exchange rates and that currencies would eventually
reflect underlying economic fundamentals.
    The U.S. Commerce Secretary is in Hong Kong after stops in
Peking and Seoul on an Asian trade tour.
