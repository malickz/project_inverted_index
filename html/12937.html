<H2>SOO LINE SOO TO SELL LAKE STATES DIVISION</H2>
Soo Line Corp said it agreed to sell
its Lake States Transportation Division to the newly formed
Wisconsin Central Ltd.
    The division conducts rail operations over about 2,000
miles of railroad in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and
Illinois. Soo Line said in January it was seeking bids for the
property.
    Terms were withheld, but Soo has estimated that the
transaction will result in a one-time after-tax loss of 8.0 to
15.0 mln dlrs.
