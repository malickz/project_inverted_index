<H2>SPAIN TO SELL BARLEY TO SAUDI ARABIA</H2>
Spain will shortly sign with Saudi Arabia
an order for barley for April/May delivery, trade sources said.
    They gave no details on amounts or prices, but said it
would be a "major" order.
    Saudi Arabia bought 500,000 tonnes of Spanish barley last
year.
