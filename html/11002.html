<H2>LOUISVILLE GASLOU TO ASK PROTECTIVE MEASURES</H2>
Louisville Gas and Electric Co
said it will ask stockholders at its May 12 annual meeting to
approve several anti-takeover proposals.
    It said the measures include staggered terms for directors
and a fair price provision that would require a potential
purchaser to make the same offer to all stockholders.
    Louisville Gas said the amendments are not in response to
any specific effort to obtain control of the company.
