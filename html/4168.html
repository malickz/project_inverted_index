<H2>JM BYGGNADS SHARES SUSPENDED ON STOCKHOLM BOURSE</H2>
Shares in building firm JM Byggnads
och Fastighets AB were suspended on the Stockholm bourse at
the company's own request, the bourse said.
    The suspension will last until the end of trading on
Friday, the bourse added in a statement, but gave no further
details.
    JM is half-owned by Skanska AB SKBS ST, which has offered
to buy out the remaining stock, but analysts said JM could have
been approached with a rival bid.
