<H2>BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED</H2>
The Bank of France said it left its
intervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds
in the market against first category paper in today's money
market intervention tender.
    Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on
the possibility of quarter point cut.
    The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was cut to
7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January.
